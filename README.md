This is the android version, built in Android Studio, coded while learning Kotlin.
 The iOS build is in the [iOS branch](https://github.com/TalonSabre/RandomFruit/tree/iOS).

All code can be found in the [MainActivity](/app/src/main/java/com/example/randomfruit/MainActivity.kt) file.

The layout is in the [activity_main](/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_main.xml) file.
 The emojis appeared transparent, but adding a second layer fixed that.

Everything is hardcoded in this version as well, and can be done better.

I'm not changing this app again anytime soon, though.
 It is here for reference and preservation.
