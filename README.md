Press Button, Get Rare Fruit.

This app was made while learning SwiftUI and Kotlin.

Everything is hardcoded, so it could be improved upon in that regard.

I'm not changing this app again anytime soon, though.
 It is here for reference and preservation.

Go to iOS branch for the Xcode project, or android branch for Android Studio.
