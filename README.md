This is the android version, built in Android Studio, coded with Kotlin.
 The iOS build is in the [iOS branch](https://github.com/TalonSabre/RandomFruit/tree/iOS).

This app was made while learning Kotlin.

Everything is hardcoded in this version as well, and can be done better.

I'm not changing this app again anytime soon, though.
 It is here for reference and preservation.
