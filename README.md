# RandomFruit
Press Button, Get Rare Fruit.

This app was made early in my process of learning SwiftUI.

It almost definitely is not the ideal way to code an app like this.
 It might be better, for example, to make each fruit conform to an object.

Regardless, I'm not changing this app again anytime soon.
 It is here for reference and preservation.
