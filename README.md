This app was made while learning SwiftUI.

This is the android version, built in Android Studio, coded with Kotlin.
 The iOS build is in the [iOS branch](https://github.com/TalonSabre/RandomFruit/tree/iOS).

Everything is hardcoded in this version as well, and can be done better.

I'm not changing this app again anytime soon, though.
 It is here for reference and preservation.
