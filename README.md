This app was made while learning SwiftUI.

I made an android version as well, found in the [android branch](https://github.com/TalonSabre/RandomFruit/tree/android).

Everything is hardcoded, so it could be improved upon in that regard.

I'm not changing this app again anytime soon, though.
 It is here for reference and preservation.
